 ATM TRANSACTION ANALYZER - Power BI Project
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing ATM transactions using Power BI, Excel, and PDF reports. 
The analysis provides insights into financial transactions (Fin Txn), non-financial transactions (Non Fin Txn), monthly revenue, operational costs, and gross profit margins for various ATMs. 
This project is ideal for those looking to understand ATM operations, profitability, and key metrics used for decision-making in the financial sector.

Key Files:
ATM_Transaction_Data.xlsx: The Excel file containing the raw data for analysis, including transaction details, costs, and revenue metrics for multiple ATMs across various locations.
ATM_Transaction_Analyzer.pbix: The Power BI report that presents the visual analysis and dashboards of the ATM transaction data.
ATM_Transaction_Analysis.pdf: A detailed report with conclusions and findings based on the analysis, explaining the insights derived from the data.

Data Description
The data provided includes the following key columns:

Year, Month, Bank, ATM ID: Basic identifiers for time, institution, and specific ATM units.
Effective Days: The number of operational days in the given period.
Financial Transactions (Fin Txn) and Non-Financial Transactions (Non Fin Txn): The types of transactions performed at the ATM (e.g., withdrawals, balance inquiries).
Monthly Revenue, MHA Revenue: The income generated from ATM transactions and other associated sources.
Cost Elements: Breakdown of costs such as site maintenance, spare parts, insurance, and onetime costs.
Gross Profit and Profit Margins: Calculated based on revenue and total operational costs, showing the profitability of each ATM.
Key Analysis & Insights

Transaction Trends:
Analysis of financial and non-financial transactions over time (monthly, quarterly).
Identifying high-performing ATMs based on transaction volumes.

Revenue & Profitability:
Calculation of monthly revenue and its comparison to operational costs.
Gross profit percentage for each ATM and categorizing them based on profitability.
Revenue performance breakdown by ATM type, location, and bank.

Cost Analysis:
Detailed breakdown of operational costs such as MHA costs, ATM maintenance (AMC), VSAT AMC, and UPS AMC.
Identifying cost drivers (e.g., site maintenance, repairs) and how they impact profitability.

Operational Performance:
Evaluation of ATMs based on uptime and effective days.
Highlighting ATMs that generate the highest revenue despite operational downtime.
Visuals & Dashboards in Power BI

The Power BI report includes interactive dashboards and visuals, such as:
Trend Analysis: Line charts to track transaction volumes and revenue over time.
